Shoes Presentation[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/PragTob/shoes_presentation.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/PragTob/shoes_presentation)
==================

A presentation about shoes - written in shoes (WIP)

## Getting it running

- Clone this repository
- Make sure you got jruby-1.7.0 or higher installed (I use jruby-1.7.4)
- run `bundle install` (this installs a current shoes4 pre-alpha release straight from github)
- run `ruby-shoes shoes_presentation.rb` (kind of optimized for 1024 * 768 since that's the beamer resolution at JRubyConf)
- use left/right arrow or paga up/down to advance. F11 to toggle fullscreen

## State of this

This is an alpha presentation software written with a pre-alpha GUI toolkit - so some things are a bit rough. Like the resolution as it does not fully adapt to every resolution - it should work, it might just look weird.
